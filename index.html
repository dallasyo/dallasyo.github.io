	<h1>Hi there, I'm Dallas! Welcome to my site.</h1>
	<p>The Man. Oh, you don't know the Man. He's everywhere. 
		In the White House, down the hall... 
		Ms. Mullins, she's the Man. 
		And the Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank! 
		Okay? 
		And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man, it was called rock 'n roll. 
		But guess what? 
		Oh no. 
		The Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV! 
		So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome, 
		'cause the Man is just gonna call you a fat washed up loser and crush your soul. 
		So do yourselves a favor and just GIVE UP!</p>
