	<h1>Hi there, I'm Dallas! Welcome to my site.</h1>
	<p>The Man. Oh, you don't know the Man. He's everywhere. <br>
		In the White House, down the hall... <br>
		Ms. Mullins, she's the Man. <br>
		And the Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank! <br>
		Okay? <br>
		And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man, it was called rock 'n roll. <br>
		But guess what? <br>
		Oh no. <br>
		The Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV!<br> 
		So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome, <br>
		'cause the Man is just gonna call you a fat washed up loser and crush your soul. <br>
		So do yourselves a favor and just GIVE UP!</p>
